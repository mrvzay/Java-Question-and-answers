## 1. Explain JVM,JDK and JRE ?

JVM, JDK, and JRE are key components in the Java programming language ecosystem, each serving a specific role in the development and execution of Java applications.

#### 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

* The JVM is a virtual machine that provides an environment for Java bytecode to be executed. Java source code is compiled into an intermediate form known as bytecode, and the JVM interprets or compiles this bytecode into native machine code, allowing Java applications to run on various hardware platforms without modification.
* The JVM provides features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), security mechanisms, and exception handling, making Java a portable and secure programming language.
* It acts as an abstraction layer between the Java application and the underlying hardware, ensuring that the same Java program can run on any device with a compatible JVM.

#### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment):

* The JRE is a software package that includes the JVM, along with libraries and other components required for running Java applications. It provides the runtime environment necessary for executing Java programs.
* In addition to the JVM, the JRE includes class libraries, Java runtime libraries, and various files and binaries needed for the execution of Java applications. It does not include development tools such as compilers and debuggers.

#### 3. JDK (Java Development Kit):

* The JDK is a full-featured software development kit for Java, containing everything needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications. It includes the JRE, the JVM, and development tools like compilers (javac), debuggers, and other utilities.
* Developers use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java code. It provides a complete set of tools for Java application development, making it an essential package for programmers working on Java projects.
* The JDK also includes documentation, sample code, and various development libraries that are not present in the JRE.


In summary, the JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode, the JRE provides the runtime environment for Java applications, and the JDK is a comprehensive development kit that includes the JRE along with development tools for building and debugging Java programs.
